RESTful media API interaction / UICollectionView / Users / Social Interaction and Service Integration

This app is a demonstration of my ability to access a popular media API, filter for my purposes and frame my results in a user-friendly interface.  In short, it allows you to search for and retrieve top music videos from the iTunes API, watch promotional content and offer validation.  *Future feature might include displaying accompanying media sources, delivered by the user initiating a search by artist content title.*
